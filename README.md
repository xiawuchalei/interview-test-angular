# Rezare Systems / Map of Agriculture Interview Test

This repository is effectively a template for our interview test.

This template contains the following:

Each of the above is stubbed out and provides some basic functionality.  
The currently implemented features are as follows:
- List of students on the home page
- API endpoint to return the full list of students

We ask that you spend two hours to do this test and start by taking a Fork of this repository.
